## Projects

### 1. Wi-Fi Channel Viewer (`wifi-channel-tool/`)
Cross-platform CLI + GUI app that reports the Wi-Fi channel of the active network. Demonstrates Python scripting, OS detection, subprocess usage, and a lightweight Tkinter interface.

## How to Use

1. **Initialize Git (first time only):**
   ```bash
   cd ~/portfolio
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Wi-Fi channel viewer"
   ```
2. **Create a new GitHub repo named `portfolio`** (via the GitHub UI).
3. **Add the remote and push:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:kobrux/portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace the remote URL with HTTPS if you prefer.

Once pushed, send the repo link (`https://github.com/kobrux/portfolio`) to future workplaces.
